<p>
Log in to the domain controller VM with the admin username mydomain.com\(adminusername) > Log in to the client VM as a normal user with the username mydomain.com\(user) (Password is Password1)
</p>
<br />

Within the domain controller VM, open File Explorer and go to the C:\ drive > create 4 folders named “read-access”, “write-access”, “no-access”, and “accounting.” 
</p>
<br />

<br />

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Within the client VM, open File Explorer > in the main search bar \\(domain controller name) > now try to access the folders previously created (Read folder should only let you view) (Write folder should let you view and save things) (No access shouldn’t be accessible in any way)
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
Go back to the domain controller VM > open Active Directory Users and Computers > right click my domain and create a new organizational unit named “_GROUPS” > within the _GROUPS folder, right click, go to New, and create a group named “ACCOUNTANTS” 
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Now go back to the C drive, go to the properties of the accounting folder > sharing tab > click share > and type “ACCOUNTANTS” and give them read/write access > click add > then click share 
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Go into the client VM and refresh the folder with the previously created folders and try to access the accounting folder (you shouldn’t be able to interact with it in any way)
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Log out of the client VM and go back to the domain controller VM > Within Active Directory Users and Computers, go to the accountants folder and double click on it > go to members and add the user you signed into the client VM to the group > click apply and ok 
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Now log back into the client VM with the user > open File Explorer > Type \\(domain controller name) in the larger search bar > now try accessing the accounting folder (you should be able to view the folder and save things)
